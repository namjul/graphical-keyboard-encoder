## NPM / Bower

Prefer modules from npm over bower
In many cases modules from npm are better than the same module from bower. Bower mostly contain only concatenated/bundled files which are:

- More difficult to handle for webpack
- More difficult to optimize for webpack
- Sometimes only useable without a module system

So prefer to use the CommonJs-style module and let webpack build it.
